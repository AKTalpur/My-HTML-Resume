    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am an ambitious, persistent, and highly personable individual with a diverse educational and professional 
        background. My professional experience, so far, has helped me to gain and polish my management skills 
        by meeting task deadlines in a dynamic fast-paced environment, public dealing with consumers, and 
        raising employee morale. Moreover, my technical background has made me a critical thinker, problem solver, 
        and change maker. With all these skills combined with a proactive personal attitude, I am seeking a role in 
        a workplace where I will get opportunities to learn and grow, and where I will be considered an asset rather 
        than a liability.
